This project implements an AI-powered waste classification system using MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning). The model is trained to automatically classify waste images into predefined categories, enabling efficient and accurate waste segregation.

The system processes an input image, performs preprocessing (resizing and normalization), extracts features using MobileNetV2, and predicts the waste category along with a confidence score. The lightweight architecture makes it suitable for real-time applications and edge devices.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python • TensorFlow/Keras • OpenCV • NumPy

🚀 Objective

To promote smart waste management by automating the segregation process and reducing manual effort.
